            <h1>Who we are</h1>
            <p>Funboy was born from a deep appreciation for unbridled joy - and the resotrative powers of truly kicking back, unplugging, and letting loose. Five years in, and we're as committed as ever to making your downtime our priority.</p>
            <p>We launched with pool floats (the ones seen all over Instagram? Yeah, that was us) and have since cast our net wide to include all sorts of summer accessories. We now offer everything from Beach Towels to Retro Beach Chairs and Aqua Water Mist Spray - and recently introduced Inflatable Shotskis and Inflatable Snowmobile Sleds for the aprés entusiasts among us. In other words: Playful essentuals you may have never knew you needed, but that make your time off that much more enjoyable.</p>
            <p>As the brainchild of two brothers and their wives, <span>Funboy</span> is, at its core, a family business - and we like to think of our customers as one of our own. We're based out of Venice Beach, California, and oversee out designs every step of the way - from the initial sketches to prototypes (which we dutifully and eagerly test out) up until the final product. And we've taken considerate steps to minimize our carbon footprint too. In short, we put immense thought, time, and love into each and every one of our pieces so that you can heartily enjoy them without a second thought.</p>
